            <div class="l-box"><b>BulkFBUploader</b> come with a number of
              useful photo manipulation options.<br>

              <ol>
                <li>Resize<br>
                  In Resize, you have two options. Either set the length of the
                  long size or the short side of your photo. For example, if
                  your photo size is 6000x4000 pixel. Resize the long side to
                  1280 will result to 1280x853 pixel. Reside the short side to
                  1280 will result to 1920x1280 pixel. Facebook recommend the
                  long side no more that 2048. <br>
                  <img class="pure-img-responsive" src="img/picset2.jpg"></li>
                <li>Canvas<br>
                  Canvas will give you a picture frame around your photo. To use
                  this, just input the canvas size by pixel into the size box.
                  If you set the value to 0, that will disable this function.<br>
                  <img class="pure-img-responsive" src="img/picset3.jpg"><br>
                  You could set the frame to different size on the 4 sides if
                  you want. Normally they are having the same size. In <b>BulkFBUploader</b>,
                  leave <b>Same Canvas Size</b> check box on check status.<br>
                  <img class="pure-img-responsive" src="img/picset4.jpg"><br>
                  The default canvas color is white. If you want to change it,
                  click on the color box and that brings you the color picker.<br>
                  <img class="pure-img-responsive" src="img/picset5.jpg"><br>
                  Click <button class="pure-button">OK</button> after you
                  select your color. <br>
                  <img class="pure-img-responsive" src="img/picset6.jpg"><br>
		  Please note that <b>BulkFBUploader</b> add the canvas on top
		  of existing image. And <b>BulkFBUploader</b> will perform the
		  resize operation before it add the canvas. If you resize an image
		  to long side of 1872 and add a canvas of 24, the result long side
		  will be 1872+24+24=1920.

                  You could add overlay text message or picture logo to your
                  picture if you check this option. Currently, the system
                  support up to 4 overlay text message/logo. To edit each
                  overlay message/picture, you need to click the line in the
                  overlay list box, edit the detail, then click <button class="pure-button">Save
                    Overlay</button> to save the edited detail. Click <button class="pure-button">Cancel
                    Overlay</button> will forfeit the change.<br>
                </li>
                <li>In Use<br>
                  If check, this overlay is in use. You could edit all the

                </li>
                <li>X Offset<br>
                  This works alone with <strong>Text Position</strong>. A
                  positive value will shift the horizontal starting point to the
                  right. A negative value will shift to the left. For example,
                  if you have a canvas of 24 pixel in size on all side, and you
                  want to put a logo at the top left corner of the actual
                  picture, you could set Text Position as Top Left, Canvas size
                  24, X offset and Y offset both 24.<br>

                  picture. The value is from 0 to 100.<br>
